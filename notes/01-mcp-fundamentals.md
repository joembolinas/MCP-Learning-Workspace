## üß† Memory Storage for Future Development Context

### Documentation-Based Memory (Current Approach)
- **Learning Notes**: Structured markdown files in notes/ directory
- **Progress Tracking**: Daily updates in progress-tracker.md
- **Code Examples**: Store working examples in projects/ directory
- **Resource Links**: Organized references in resources/ directory

### Knowledge Graph Integration
- Use MCP servers to build knowledge graphs of learned concepts
- Store relationships between ideas, code patterns, and solutions
- Enable semantic search across accumulated knowledge
- Connect related concepts automatically

### Database-Backed Context Storage
- Implement MCP server with database resources
- Store development patterns, code snippets, and solutions
- Enable querying by tags, dates, project types
- Maintain version history of learning evolution

### Git-Based Memory
- Commit messages as learning log entries
- Branch names reflecting learning phases
- Tags for major milestones and working solutions
- README files as context summaries

### Future MCP Server Ideas for Memory
- **Learning Assistant Server**: Stores and retrieves personal learning context
- **Code Pattern Server**: Manages reusable code templates and examples
- **Project Memory Server**: Maintains context across multiple development projects
- **Decision Log Server**: Records architectural decisions and reasoning
